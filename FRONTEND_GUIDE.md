- here are some critical mismatches that will cause failures:
  - Transaction creation is missing the required timestamp in two services.
  - Response shapes aren’t consistent across services (some expect the “data” wrapper, some don’t).
  - “Pending transactions” isn’t called correctly in the new service.
  - There are duplicate/legacy services with inconsistent base URLs and paths; you should consolidate to one.
- Several endpoints from the doc (explorer- and network-maintenance-related) are not wrapped at all in the frontend yet; you’ll want to add those if the UI will use them.
Endpoint-by-endpoint verification

1. 1.
   GET /
- Backend doc: available.
- Frontend:
  - Implemented in new service as getEndpoints() and in JS legacy service.
  - Status: OK in `app/services/blockchain.ts` and `src/services/blockchain.js` .
2. 1.
   POST /transactions
- Backend requires sender, recipient, amount, signature, timestamp (required), and validates addresses.
- Frontend:
  - New service posts to /transactions but omits timestamp. This will likely fail backend validation.
  - Legacy JS service also omits timestamp.
  - Legacy TS service posts to /transactions/new (not in the doc) and includes timestamp.
- Status: Needs fixes.
  - In the new service and the JS legacy service, add timestamp: Date.now().
  - In the legacy TS service, change endpoint from /transactions/new to /transactions (or confirm backend supports /transactions/new, which the doc does not show).
3. 1.
   GET /mine[?miner_address=...]
- Backend supports optional miner_address.
- Frontend:
  - New service calls /mine without params (OK).
  - Legacy TS service supports passing miner_address (also OK).
  - Legacy JS calls /mine without params (OK).
- Status: OK.
4. 1.
   GET /chain
- Backend response shape (doc) wraps in { data: { chain: [...] } }.
- Frontend:
  - New service expects { data: { chain } } and returns an array (OK).
  - Legacy JS returns response.data directly (unclear; if backend wraps in data, screens using this will need to unwrap).
  - Legacy TS expects response.data.chain (no data wrapper), which mismatches the doc.
- Status: Mixed; prefer the new service’s shape. If any screens still use src/services, standardize them to the same expected shape.
5. 1.
   POST /nodes/register
- Backend expects body { nodes: [...] }.
- Frontend:
  - Implemented in all services with the correct shape.
- Status: OK.
6. 1.
   GET /nodes/resolve
- Frontend:
  - Implemented in all services.
- Status: OK.
7. 1.
   GET /nodes
- Backend returns { data: { nodes: [...] } }.
- Frontend:
  - New service expects { data: { nodes } } (OK).
  - Legacy TS expects { nodes } (mismatch with doc).
  - Legacy JS tries to read response.data.nodes and then also persists locally; may not match doc.
- Status: Standardize to expect { data: { nodes } } everywhere if you follow the doc.
8. 1.
   DELETE /nodes/{host:port}
9. 2.
   POST /nodes/unregister
- Frontend:
  - Not implemented in any service yet.
- Status: Missing wrappers. Add if your network screen needs removing nodes.
10. 1.
    GET /pending_tx
- Backend returns { transactions: [...] }.
- Frontend:
  - New service’s getPendingTransactions() doesn’t call this endpoint; it fakes by returning the transactions of the latest block from /chain. That’s not the same as a mempool.
  - Legacy TS service correctly calls /pending_tx.
  - Legacy JS has no direct pending_tx wrapper.
- Status: Fix the new service to call GET /pending_tx and return response.data.transactions.
11. 1.
    GET /balance/{address}
- Frontend:
  - Implemented in all services.
- Status: OK.
12. 1.
    GET /blocks/latest?limit=...
13. 2.
    GET /blocks/{height}
14. 3.
    GET /blocks/hash/{hash}
15. 4.
    GET /transactions/latest?limit=...
16. 5.
    GET /transactions/{hash}
17. 6.
    GET /address/{address}/transactions?limit=&before=
18. 7.
    GET /mining/status
- Frontend:
  - Not implemented in the services yet.
- Status: Missing wrappers. If the explorer screens and mining tutorial use these, add corresponding service functions.
Other important integration details

- Duplicate service layers and base URLs:
  
  - New service uses http://127.0.0.1:8000 (matches doc) in `app/services/blockchain.ts` .
  - Legacy TS uses http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:5000 in `src/services/blockchain.ts` .
  - Legacy JS uses a dev LAN IP at port 8000 in `src/services/blockchain.js` .
  - Recommendation: Consolidate on the new service under app/services and remove/stop importing the legacy ones, or ensure all use the same baseURL and the same response shapes.
- Device vs simulator vs local host:
  
  - 127.0.0.1 works on iOS simulator (host loops back to your Mac), but NOT on a real device. On real device you must use your Mac’s LAN IP (e.g., http://192.168.x.x:8000 ).
  - You already have setApiBaseUrl in the new service; use it at app init time to switch base URL depending on environment.
  - If you test on Android emulator, remember 10.0.2.2:8000 instead of 127.0.0.1.
- Transaction validation:
  
  - Backend requires sender/recipient to match ^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{6,}$.
  - Your mock wallet generator in both services produces 0x<random base36/hex-ish>; it should meet the regex, but ensure length is sufficient. If not, API calls will fail validation.
  - Make sure to include timestamp on transaction creation (see above) and send a non-empty signature string.
- Response wrapper consistency:
  
  - The doc wraps several responses in a top-level { data: ... }. Your new service already handles that for /chain and /nodes. Make sure every service method and every screen is consistent with the backend’s wrapper to avoid undefined errors.
- “Pending” in UI:
  
  - `HomeScreen.js` calls getPendingTransactions() from ../services/blockchain. Depending on which file is resolved, you might be getting either:
    - A fake pending list from the last block (new service), or
    - The correct mempool from GET /pending_tx (legacy TS).
  - This inconsistency can cause incorrect UI stats. Standardize the implementation in the one service you keep.
What’s missing to be fully “integration-ready”

- Critical fixes required before requests won’t fail:
  
  - Add timestamp: Date.now() when creating transactions in:
    - `app/services/blockchain.ts`
    - `src/services/blockchain.js`
  - Change legacy TS to POST /transactions (unless you truly have /transactions/new on the backend) in:
    - `src/services/blockchain.ts`
  - Make getPendingTransactions in the new service call GET /pending_tx and return response.data.transactions in:
    - `app/services/blockchain.ts`
  - Normalize response shapes across services to match the doc’s { data: ... } format (especially for /chain and /nodes).
  - Unify baseURL config; use setApiBaseUrl at runtime to switch to your LAN IP when testing on a device.
- Nice-to-have wrappers to support explorer/tutorial features (add to your service if you’ll use them in UI):
  
  - GET /blocks/latest?limit=
  - GET /blocks/{height}
  - GET /blocks/hash/{hash}
  - GET /transactions/latest?limit=
  - GET /transactions/{hash}
  - GET /address/{address}/transactions?limit=&before=
  - GET /mining/status
  - DELETE /nodes/{host:port}, POST /nodes/unregister
Verdict

- You have enough of the core endpoints to integrate the basics (view chain, create transactions, mine, register nodes, consensus, balance), but you need to:
  - Fix the transaction creation payload (timestamp required).
  - Standardize response handling to match the documented “data” wrapper.
  - Implement pending_tx properly.
  - Consolidate to a single service layer.
  - Align base URLs.
- For explorer and network management beyond the basics, add wrappers for the additional endpoints listed above.
